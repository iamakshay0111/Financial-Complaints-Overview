FINANCIAL COMPLAINTS DASHBOARD

Problem Statement

Background: A financial institution wants to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer complaints to improve their customer service and compliance with regulations. The organization collects and manages data on complaints, and it is essential to present this data effectively for informed decision-making.

Objective: Design a Power BI dashboard to provide a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and relevant charts for the financial institution to gain insights into customer complaints and their resolution status.

KPIs:

Total Complaints: Track the overall volume of customer complaints over time to identify trends and fluctuations.

Timely Response: Measure the percentage of complaints that received a response within an acceptable time frame, highlighting the institution's responsiveness to customer concerns.

In Progress: Monitor the number of unresolved complaints currently being addressed, providing insight into the workload of the customer service team.

Disputed Rate: Calculate the percentage of complaints that escalated to disputes, reflecting the severity and complexity of issues faced by customers.

Resolved at no Cost: Analyse the percentage of complaints that were resolved without any monetary compensation, indicating the effectiveness of non-financial resolution methods.

Charts:

Total Complaints by Issue: Display a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of complaints by the type of issue, helping the institution understand the most common problems faced by customers.

Total Complaints by State: Create a geographical map or bar chart showing the distribution of complaints by state or region, allowing the organization to identify areas with higher complaint rates.

Total Complaints by Product: Utilize a pie chart or bar chart to illustrate the distribution of complaints by the financial products or services involved, offering insights into which offerings require the most attention.

% of Consumer Disputed: Present a pie chart or donut chart to depict the percentage of complaints that escalated to disputes, allowing the institution to assess the impact of disputes on overall complaint resolution.

Key Challenges:

Data Integration: Gathering and integrating complaint data from various sources may pose challenges in data consistency and quality.

Timeliness: Ensuring that the data is up-to-date and reflective of the most recent complaints.

Data Security: Protecting sensitive customer information and adhering to privacy regulations while working with complaint data.

Visualization: Creating clear and intuitive visualizations in Power BI to convey the insights effectively.

Expected Outcomes: The Power BI dashboard will empower the financial institution to track, analyse, and address customer complaints more efficiently, leading to improved customer satisfaction, compliance, and operational effectiveness. This project aims to provide a holistic view of the complaint landscape and promote data-driven decision-making within the organization.
